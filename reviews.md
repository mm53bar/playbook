#Quarterly Reviews

In order to continually improve ourselves and the company, all year round on every project we're on, we receive regular feedback from clients, managers, and teammates. We additionally have formal quarterly reviews.

During onboarding, a "Quarterly Review" calendar event is created, set to recur once every 3 months, starting from the hire date.

Ahead of the quarterly review, our manager collects anonymous feedback from everyone we've worked with in the quarter, and everyone in our office. The team feedback is shared with us before the review.

The agenda for quarterly reviews is roughly:

* Review the feedback from team members
* Our performance on recent consulting projects
* Our investment time contributions
* Our satisfaction with our work, projects, and the company
* Our questions about thoughtbot and our strategy
* Our areas of focus for the next quarter

The results of the quarterly review are recorded and influence future compensation increases.
