#Interviewing

(stolen from Thoughtbot - https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/our-company/hiring)

We track each candidate's progress through the interview process on a Trello card on our "Hiring" board.

Our CEO leads the hiring process. He ensures that everyone gets a response and he speaks with everyone before they are hired.

Anyone can do an initial review of the candidate's application. In particular, they review the candidate's code sample or portfolio. If necessary, they may ask someone else (like a designer or iOS developer) for another pair of eyes on the code or portfolio.

We either send them a rejection or an email based on [this template](https://gist.github.com/croaky/3e12ff226d6b04451fe8), moving the Trello card to "Non-Technical Interview".

The CEO will pull the managing director, designers, or developers into subsequent discussions, putting their faces on the Trello cards to ensure we always know who is responsible.

We have standard questions for iOS developers, Rails developers, and designers for the technical interview. We don't use puzzles or code challenges. Instead, we prefer reviewing actual work the candidate has done, and talking to them about design process, architecting systems, and writing code; the same thing we do for work every day.

The final step for candidates is to visit us for a day. We pay for their flights and three nights of hotels (rest up Thursday night, work with us on Friday, enjoy Friday night, explore the city Saturday, fly home Sunday).

On that day, developers pair program with one of our developers in the morning and another in the afternoon.

Designers pair in the morning and work on a small product design project throughout the day and then present at 4pm. It primarily involves sketching and working with one or two thoughtbot designers.

We do the interviews this way because there's no substitute for seeing someone actually do the work and interacting with the team. We also want candidates to experience what the company is like for themselves.

Aside from technical skill, during the entire interview process, we look for character strengths like enthusiasm (invigorates others), focus (pays attention, resists distractions, remembers directions), composure (remains calm when critiqued, doesn't interrupt), gratitude (shows appreciation), curiosity (eager to explore, asks questions to understand, actively listens), optimism (gets over frustrations quickly), grit (finishes what he or she starts, doesn't get blocked), emotional intelligence (demonstrates respect for others' feelings, knows when and how to include others), humor (likes to laugh, makes others smile), and appreciation of beauty (notices and appreciates beauty and excellence).

To be hired, the candidate must get a unanimous "yes" from the existing teammates with whom they interacted.
