Offer and Onboarding
We use RightSignature ($14-$49/month) to send the offer and get them signed without the "print and scan" process on either end.

Offers are reviewed and approved by at least one member of the C-level executive team before being sent. C-level executives and Managing Directors can execute offers on behalf of thoughtbot.

When the offer is accepted, we run a custom onboarding script which we wrote. It creates the teammate's email address, gives them access to systems like GitHub and Slack, sends them their Employment Agreement, notifies Accounting, sends a welcome email to the teammate, and creates a todo list for the hiring manager for any remaining manual items that we haven't been able to automate.

We assign a pair to new team members who acts as a guide on their first day. The pair helps them set up their machine, purchase any required software, and walk them through one turn of the development cycle by getting their profile added to our website. The pair also makes them feel comfortable, answers questions they may have, or points them to the person who can answer their questions.
